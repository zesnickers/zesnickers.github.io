                  <font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" color="white">&quot;Okay,&quot; Trazir 
                  said, &quot;send the money over to my new character, bro.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  I stared at the balance long and hard. 480,000,000. I was lost 
                  in thought, imagining all the possibilities that half a 
                  billion credits would bring me. Images of splendor and 
                  prosperity flashed in my head, rapid fire. I would be the 
                  commander of a fleet of battleships, and a harem of beautiful 
                  women would fawn over me every second of the day. And even if 
                  I were to die, they would resort to having lesbian sex with 
                  each other in front of my 40 foot shrine, forever worshipping 
                  my wealth in this life and beyond. The CEOs of the largest 
                  corporations and the GMs of the biggest servers would heel 
                  before my command, and I would have absolute dominion over 
                  every last atom in the universe. <br>
                  <br>
                  I would be God.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Dude? Come on, send it over.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  I couldn't hear him. I didn't WANT to hear him. The money was 
                  mine, wasn't it? It was my idea, wasn't it? What the hell had 
                  Trazir done this entire time, other than write a few message 
                  board posts? Why should he be deserving of my hard earned 
                  profits?<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Um.... Hello? Are you there?&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Yeah, I'm here.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  I wanted to tear out his vocal chords and throw them out the 
                  window. I wanted to hear him scream for mercy, and say that I 
                  could have all the credits for myself. I wanted a lot of 
                  things.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;So, you gonna wire those credits any time soon, or am I just 
                  going to have to come over there and make you send them? I 
                  really want that money man, come on, tell me you're gonna send 
                  it.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;FINE!&quot; I put 1 isk in the wire transfer box, and hit send.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Very funny. MAN, COME ON, SEND THE FUCKING MONEY.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  He was being roused from his normally copacetic state. Trazir 
                  was a big guy, and I had seen him before many a time under 
                  alcohol-induced rages. There was nothing scarier to me at that 
                  moment than a six and a half foot heavy-set man whose temper 
                  had been left at home. I placed 179,999,999 of my hard-earned 
                  isk of my in the wire transfer box and sent it. My heart sunk.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Awesome! Now that's what I'm talkin' about man. Thanks!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  I had just been extorted to the tune of about $1000. No 
                  matter; I would doubtlessly make it back and more with the 300 
                  million isk I currently possessed. I slipped back into fantasy 
                  mode, only this time, something wasn't quite right. I had my 
                  own battleship, only this time, there was no fleet. There was 
                  no harem of beautiful women wanting to jump my bones at any 
                  given moment of the day; instead, there was only one 
                  moderately attractive girl who seemed kind of interested in 
                  me. CEOs viewed me with respect and a touch of admiration, but 
                  the Gamemasters looked down upon all of us contemptuously. <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Hey, can you send that money back for a second? I need to see 
                  it again, for, uh, corporate.... purposes. Come on, just let 
                  me see it, one last time.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;FUCK NO! Do you think I'm stupid or something?&quot; He laughed, 
                  and continued on. &quot;Listen man, you have no idea how happy this 
                  makes me. But I've gotta go eat dinner now. We can talk 
                  later.&quot; Click.<br>
                  <br>
                  I stared, empty, into the far reaches of space. The newbie NPC 
                  trainer was repeatedly messaging my new character with 
                  instructions about how to play the game, filling my inbox to 
                  the brink with annoying, pointless messages. I readied my 
                  starter laser and fired a pitiful shot at the trainer; his 
                  shield integrity was down to 99%.<br>
                  <br>
                  The police wasted no time. Three cruisers were on me within 
                  seconds, and the very sight of them must have caused my newbie 
                  ship to quiver in fear and spontaneously combust, because nary 
                  a shot was fired before I respawned at the closest base, 
                  pod-death and all. Although I had the money, there was nothing 
                  fun I could do with it. My character had minimal skills and 
                  therefore could only pilot the shittiest of ships. It would be 
                  months before he would be sufficiently trained to pilot a 
                  battleship. In RPG weapon terms, my current ship was a rusty 
                  dagger, and the best ship I would be able to fly was an aging 
                  kitchen knife. I logged off Eve, and watched my desktop; my 
                  eyes wavered to the Trillian shortcut, but quickly averted 
                  themselves. I knew that if I entered any messaging programs, I 
                  would be quickly and brutally raped. My fragile emotional 
                  state was at stake.<br>
                  <br>
                  I opened it anyway.<br>
                  <br>
                  Ackbar's 3 holy words resonated through my brain as each 
                  program opened up. Thoggins was the first.<br>
                  <br>
                  Thoggins: Tell me something, Nightfreeze, WHY haven't you 
                  picked up the phone yet? AFRAID? I knew you would do something 
                  like this, you fucking scumbag. FUCK YOU!<br>
                  <br>
                  Nightfreeze: Thoggins! My dear old friend, how are you doing 
                  this eve? How's the girlfriend? Oh wait, you don't have a 
                  girlfriend. You don't even have any money, because your ass 
                  just got scammed. Doesn't it taste good? Bitch.<br>
                  <br>
                  Thoggins: I swear to god, if I ever find you in real life, I 
                  will beat the everliving piss out of you, YOU LITTLE SHIT.<br>
                  <br>
                  Nightfreeze: Thoggins, my good man, why do continue to accost 
                  me? You gave me your money, fair and square, remember? 
                  Hahahahaahahahahahahahhahahah.<br>
                  <br>
                  Thoggins: Guess what, asshole? I was one of the earliest 
                  hackers in the 1980s. I KNEW Kevin Mitnick. Phone Phreaking is 
                  as secondary to me as skullfucking your daughter. I'm going to 
                  keep calling your house, OVER AND OVER, and the phone company 
                  will NEVER be able to trace the call. You're going down.<br>
                  <br>
                  I had had quite enough of Thoggins. I promptly clicked on the 
                  &quot;block&quot; button and prayed for the innocent voyeurs browsing 
                  the erotica section who would pick up the phone and be 
                  confronted by a screaming man threatening to kill for stealing 
                  his money. Oh well, shit happens.<br>
                  <br>
                  Neither Magnulus nor Jorpho had queried me yet, so I took the 
                  intiative by sending them both the same note and blocking 
                  them.<br>
                  <br>
                  Me: Hi there, buddy! I'd like to thank you from the bottom of 
                  my heart for investing in the official ZZZZ Best Apocalypse 
                  Blueprint Pool. Unfortunately, a group of pirating ruffians 
                  ran off with the credits you so faithfully endowed to my 
                  organization. Since there was no insurance clause in the 
                  contract, I'm afraid that your investment is now gone forever. 
                  If you would like more information about my company, and a 
                  possible chance for reimbursement, go to google and do a 
                  search for ZZZZ Best. Cheers!<br>
                  <br>
                  Suddenly, he messaged me. The useless one.<br>
                  <br>
                  HardHead: Hey man, Thoggins has been telling all of us that 
                  you took the money and ran. He's wrong, isn't he? I've known 
                  you for months now man, I mean, hell, you have a family and 
                  everything, I know you wouldn't do something like that. So 
                  what's up? Why does it say &quot;Character Doesn't Exist&quot; when I 
                  try to send you messages in Eve?<br>
                  <br>
                  Nightfreeze: Hello friend! I'm gonna write something, so tell 
                  me, are you reading closely?<br>
                  <br>
                  HardHead: Yeah. What is it?<br>
                  <br>
                  Nightfreeze: I just scammed the fuck out of you.<br>
                  <br>
                  Hardhead: ......<br>
                  <br>
                  HardHead: But why? Why would you do something like this? I 
                  THOUGHT WE WERE FRIENDS.<br>
                  <br>
                  HardHead: Hell man, I LOANED YOU MONEY. I just don't 
                  understand, how could you DO THIS TO ME? <br>
                  <br>
                  HardHead: Jesus Christ... I don't even know how to respond... 
                  I hate to say it, but man, I'm almost crying right now.<br>
                  <br>
                  HardHead: I don't think I'll ever be able to trust another 
                  person again. Thanks man. Thanks.<br>
                  <br>
                  *HardHead Logs Off*<br>
                  <br>
                  There was nothing left for me in the barren wasteland of 
                  online chatting. I followed HardHead's example, and dismissed 
                  myself for the night.<br>
                  <br>
                  My eyelids trembled as if they felt the vast cyclic movement 
                  of the earth and her watchers, trembled as if they felt the 
                  felt the strange light of some new world. Sunshine streamed 
                  through the window, and the shackles of duty slowly began to 
                  fall with each gradual upward movement of my torso. I leapt 
                  out of bed and stood straight, high, free! Eve was nothing 
                  more than a faded memory to me now; the world was calling me, 
                  and my soul was leaping at the call, to live, to err, to fall, 
                  to triumph, to recreate life out of life!<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;ENOUGH OF THIS DAMNED GAME!!&quot; I shouted, my booming voice 
                  causing a freshly awoken dog to begin howling at the day. I 
                  jogged to my computer and started Eve Online. I flew my 
                  starter ship out to the closest asteroid field and struck up a 
                  conversation with a player named Frosttt.<br>
                  <br>
                  Me: Hi. What would you say if I were to offer you 300 million 
                  isk?<br>
                  <br>
                  Frosttt: id say it was pretty kool lol<br>
                  <br>
                  I wired the credits to him and logged off.<br>
                  <br>
                  I never logged back in again.</font><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" color="white"><br>
