                  story of deception, intrigue, and doublecrossing. It is a 
                  story of liars, bandits, and greed. It is a story of the worst 
                  of the human condition, and how the motive for profit will 
                  drive a normally nice guy to the deepest depths of evil and 
                  betrayal.<br>
                  <br>
                  This is the story of my life in Eve Online.<br>
                  <br>
                  Eve Online is a space-based MMORPG with a level of depth and 
                  breadth that blows games like Shadowbane and City of Heroes 
                  out of the water. It is also a beautiful game, with glaring 
                  suns, shining stars, and exorbitant ship detail. Beneath its 
                  gilded beauty, though, there lies a poorly designed game which 
                  rewards the greedy and violent, and punishes the hardworking 
                  and honest; and if you think about it, that's a good 
                  representation of capitalism. I first started playing Eve a 
                  few weeks before it came out, in April 2003, and quickly 
                  picked up the essentials of the game. This would prove 
                  invaluable later on, since Eve was released with a 
                  money-making loophole that gave me the opportunity to make the 
                  starting capital I would need to successfully pull off what 
                  was probably the biggest scam in the game.<br>
                  <br>
                  Unfortunately, in order to reach the point where you can revel 
                  in a deep and absorbing level of gameplay, you need to have 
                  credits. Lots and lots of credits. And you couldn't easily get 
                  credits by killing NPC enemies, or &quot;pirates&quot; as the game 
                  designers labeled them, because these pirates would either 
                  spawn in huge overpowered groups capable of ganking even the 
                  best equipped mid-level ships in under a second, or they would 
                  spawn so far apart and drop such shitty loot that the idea of 
                  killing them for profit was ridiculous.<br>
                  <br>
                  Since crafting was never really my style, building ships and 
                  then selling them was out of the question. This left me with 
                  two options: I could run trade routes, or I could mine 
                  asteroids.<br>
                  <br>
                  The entire concept of mining in Eve consists of pressing Ctrl 
                  + F, finding an asteroid, then auto piloting your ship over to 
                  it and watching little pebbles of rock float into your ship 
                  from the asteroid; you would then wait 5-10 minutes for the 
                  asteroid to dissolve, and do the same thing, over and over, 
                  for hours on end, until your ship was full of space pebbles. 
                  You would then sell these pebbles for approximately the same 
                  price that an illiterate slave would have received for an 
                  ounce of cotton. In case you haven't deduced by now, mining in 
                  Eve Online is about as fun as fucking a fat chick's festering 
                  corpse.<br>
                  <br>
                  Running trade routes, unlike mining, actually involved a 
                  degree of intelligence and acumen. The basic premise of a 
                  trade route was to bring low priced materials from one sector 
                  of the galaxy to another sector where they would sell for a 
                  high price. Buy low, sell high. With a big ship, the right 
                  kinds of goods, and the knowledge of which routes were 
                  profitable and which were dry, a person could make tens of 
                  millions of credits in a night's work. For a short while, I 
                  was one of those people. <br>
                  <br>
                  My first few weeks after the release of Eve were boring ones. 
                  I would log on after school, mine pebbles for hours with my 
                  best friend Trazir, and then sell those pebbles to NPC vendors 
                  for scant amounts of money. My labors were not without a goal, 
                  however; after talking to some extremely successful people in 
                  the game, and doing research on the various ship types, Trazir 
                  and I set a goal for ourselves: To collectively possess two 
                  million credits by the end of our second week. We would use 
                  this money to buy an industrial ship, cargo expanders, and two 
                  of the ever-essential micro warp drives, or MWDs. The 
                  industrial ships in Eve, or &quot;indies&quot;, were huge. They could 
                  carry a gargantuan amount of cargo, made even larger by cargo 
                  expanders, and were relatively inexpensive to buy. This big 
                  cargo space made it possible to transport ample quantities of 
                  goods and make a large profit.<br>
                  <br>
                  There was just one problem: Indies were slower than fucking 
                  hell when they weren't in warp drive, and therefore they were 
                  prone to destruction at the hands of pricks who camped at warp 
                  gates and PKed innocent traders. This was where the MWDs came 
                  in; if you came upon some unsavory characters upon leaving 
                  warp drive near the warp gate, you would turn on the MWDs and 
                  blast away to safety. I cannot even begin to recall the number 
                  of times that my life was saved thanks to my trusty MWDs. By 
                  this point, I had a pimped out indy with cargo expanders and 
                  several MWDs. The only problem was that I was broke again; I 
                  sure as fuck wasn't gonna make much money as a trader if I 
                  didn't have any credits to buy trading goods in the first 
                  place. So, I did what any business major would do when looking 
                  to start an intergalactic enterprise:<br>
                  <br>
                  I took out a loan. <br>
                  <br>
                  Over the course of my short-lived mining career, I met a guy 
                  named &quot;HardHead&quot; who frequented the same asteroid field that I 
                  did each night. After a few hours of in-game chatting, I got 
                  his ICQ number and talked to him on a semi-regular basis. His 
                  real name was Vinnie, and he was one of those uber-nerds with 
                  4 computers running the same game at once; he told me about 
                  how he set up mining macros on his other 3 computers and made 
                  about 250,000 credits of pure profit each night by simply 
                  leaving his computers running. This intrigued me, and he even 
                  sent me the program he used called &quot;EZmacro&quot;, but alas, I was 
                  far too lazy to ever record a macro and make sure it ran 
                  perfectly. HardHead's masochism paid off in generous dividends 
                  though; while Trazir and I were dumpster-shit broke, HH had 
                  close to 6 million credits. I told him about my trade route 
                  ideas, about how if he invested in me I would make him into a 
                  virtual Donald Trump. I fed him the finest bullshit cuisine on 
                  this side of the Atlantic, spooning it down his throat one 
                  gentle swallow at a time. By the end of the night, my credit 
                  count read &quot;3,000,017&quot;. I went to sleep contented, fully 
                  intending to pay back HardHead's money with a healthy 
                  spattering of interest.<br>
