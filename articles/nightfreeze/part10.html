                  The beeping slowly grew, first starting as a mildly 
                  pleasurable melody, but rapidly escalating into a sonorous 
                  screech. The time was 6:31 AM, and if I didn't fuck up too 
                  badly today, hundreds of millions of credits awaited me. I 
                  would live as a king, a veritable ruler over the Eve universe. 
                  But first I would need to deal with Thoggins &amp; Co. I slammed 
                  my palm onto the off button and walked over to my computer, 
                  marvelling at the never-old process of billions of bits of 
                  data being shuffled, transmuted, and forced ahead in some kind 
                  of digital death march. I opened up Outlook, hoping, nay, 
                  expecting to see multiple emails from prospective investors. I 
                  was not disappointed.<br>
                  <br>
                  The first was from Thoggins:<br>
                  <br>
                  DONT FORGET. Be on AIM at 12 PM, or you won't see a DIME.<br>
                  <br>
                  It took every ounce of willpower to hold myself back from 
                  clicking the &quot;Reply&quot; button and ripping him a new asshole. <br>
                  <br>
                  The second was from Magnulus; it was a fairly long email 
                  explaining how impressed he was with my presentation, but was 
                  unable to commit to any financial obligation at the present 
                  time because his corporation had not yet voted on the measure. 
                  I felt like telling him to grow a pair and just fucking do it. 
                  The third was from Jorpho. He wrote that normally, he would 
                  never do something like this, but that he found me to be a man 
                  of exceptional character and integrity, and felt safe with his 
                  trust in me . More importantly, he wanted an Apocalypse 
                  blueprint really badly, and was willing to invest 120 million 
                  for a second, upgraded one. <br>
                  <br>
                  A smile spontaneously broke out on my face. Despite its 
                  palling darkness, the room grew lighter, the air tasted 
                  fresher, and my heart glided like an eagle, majestic and rich 
                  and free. <br>
                  <br>
                  Heavenly God! cried my soul, in an outburst of profane joy.<br>
                  <br>
                  For a few minutes, I actually pranced around the room. I 
                  returned to my chair and felt compelled to go outside and bask 
                  in the sun, but the inbox brought me down from my wonderful 
                  high. Alltech's vote was beyond my control, I knew that much, 
                  which left one loose string for me to tie. I pondered over 
                  whether I should actually give the little prick my phone 
                  number, and the possibility entered my mind that after I 
                  punk'd him of his money, he would follow through on his 
                  promise and cause me an endless amount of phone grief. Then, 
                  it happened.<br>
                  <br>
                  Inspiration.<br>
                  <br>
                  There was a library near my house with a red receptionist's 
                  telephone at the very back. Normally, this wouldn't be 
                  anything to brag about; however, this particular telephone 
                  never, ever had a receptionist stationed near it. The 
                  librarians tended to avoid it as well, due to the fact that it 
                  was right next to the erotica section, (yay for public 
                  funding) and all but one of the librarians were conservative 
                  women who found the idea of pre-marital sex in any position 
                  but missionary to be appalling. I memorized the number as a 
                  child, before the days of star 69 and caller ID, and I would 
                  crank call it to find out who was browsing for erotica. If 
                  somebody was ballsy enough to pick up, I would direct them 
                  towards the S&amp;M book. The one where the first page describes, 
                  in detail, a man having his penis torn off. That book was 
                  later removed or stolen, I shall never know which, but I never 
                  thought back then that my childhood antics would serve me in 
                  the future. I knew exactly what I was going to do.<br>
                  <br>
                  11:45 AM rolled around, and I put on my running shoes and 
                  shorts. I stretched my feeble joints for 10 minutes, hoping 
                  that my limbs would remember their glory days of running cross 
                  country and revitalize themselves. It was time.<br>
                  <br>
                  I logged onto AIM, and Thoggins messaged me immediately.<br>
                  <br>
                  Thoggins: You're a minute late. Now, what's your phone number? 
                  I need to have it before I go through with this.<br>
                  <br>
                  Nightfreeze: I can totally understand that
                  <img src="smile.gif.html" border="0" width="15" height="15">. Can 
                  you wait 5 minutes before calling though? The only phone in 
                  our house is in the kitchen, and I figure that as long as I'm 
                  in the ol' Food Kingdom, I would fix myself up a snack.<br>
                  <br>
                  Thoggins: Uh... Okay, whatever, I'll call in 5 minutes. What's 
                  the number?<br>
                  <br>
                  Nightfreeze: [Library Number]. Remember, 5 minutes, I might 
                  not pick up if you call before then because I'll be too busy 
                  making my food. Talk to ya then
                  <img src="smile.gif.html" border="0" width="15" height="15"><br>
                  <br>
                  I logged off AIM and ran like a starving coyote chasing down 
                  his dinner. I ran like Steve Prefontaine if he had had a 
                  second chance with the grim reaper to run home drunk instead 
                  of drive, the only condition being that he would have to make 
                  it back before the car did. I ran like a brotha running from 
                  the police.<br>
                  <br>
                  I arrived in front of the building with 3 minutes to spare, 
                  vigorously gasping for air. But I wasn't done yet. I would 
                  have to make my way through the complex armed only with my 
                  wits and my deadly kung-fu grip, avoiding librarians through 
                  deception and misdirection, lest they foil the scheme I had 
                  worked on for so many hours. I walked through the double 
                  doors, with 1 minute and 57 seconds on the clock.<br>
                  <br>
                  The female receptionist spotted me the moment I walked in. 
                  Maybe it was my suave demeanor, maybe it was my dashing good 
                  looks, or maybe it was the fact that I was wearing a pair of 
                  running shorts that extended halfway down to my thighs in an 
                  air-conditioned library. Maybe it was some twisted combination 
                  of the three.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Hello, sir.&quot; She smiled uneasily and looked back down, 
                  pretending to return to whatever activity she had been 
                  pursuing before I entered her life. I made the decision that 
                  if she came within 10 feet of me, I would have to kill her and 
                  hide the body in the shadows, where no patrolling librarians 
                  would ever dare looking.<br>
                  <br>
                  I strolled over to the red phone without incident or bother, 
                  and noticed that there was no chair to accomodate anybody who 
                  might want to place an urgent telephone call regarding 
                  erotica. I glanced back to the center of the library, with its 
                  abundant tables and plush chairs. I pondered for a second 
                  whether or not it was worth the risk, but my stream of thought 
                  was broken instantly by a loud ringing sound. I looked down at 
                  my watch. <br>
                  <br>
