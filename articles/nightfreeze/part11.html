                  <font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" color="white">I let the 
                  phone ring two times before picking up the receiver.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;You're early.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  I could feel a wicked pulse beginning to radiate through the 
                  cord, rapidly working its way toward my inner ear canal. I 
                  held the phone a good 6 inches away, afraid that his voice 
                  might infect my very soul. What I next heard confirmed my 
                  gravest fears; the raspy noise emitted from this banana shaped 
                  object sunk to the depths of my heart, and would haunt my 
                  dreams for months afterward. If Beelzebub himself was an angry 
                  600 pound man with a lisp, he would be Thoggins. <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I count on the element of surprise. Now let's get one thing 
                  straight: we aren't friends, we aren't buddies, we aren't even 
                  acquaintances, so don't run any of your bullshit on me. We're 
                  two strangers in a business deal, and that's it. I think 
                  you're a two-faced son of a bitch with an agenda, but that 
                  doesn't change the fact that your deal APPEARS to be 
                  legitimate and is the only thing going on the player market.&quot; 
                  He was breathing heavily, his lungs desperately grabbing for 
                  the heroic air molecules that would be pumped through his 
                  evil, bloated arteries.<br>
                  <br>
                  I reciprocated his action by breathing heavily as well, but 
                  for an entirely different reason. My fists tightened, my teeth 
                  slowly grinded against each other, and my eyes burned. I 
                  wouldn't allow myself to sabotage hundreds of millions of 
                  credits for a small amount of ego gratification. I just 
                  wouldn't.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I'm sorry if I said anything that would lead you to think 
                  that. I'm just trying to arrange a mutually beneficial deal 
                  here, ya know?&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;No, I don't. But I called to talk business, so let's talk 
                  business. I want to be the first in line to get that 
                  battleship, and I know that according to the contract you set 
                  up, the biggest investor not only gets the first copy, but he 
                  also gets the original blueprint. So tell me, who's the 
                  biggest investor, and how much has he invested? And you had 
                  BETTER not lie to me, because I have my ways of checking up on 
                  people. If I find out that you have been lying, the first 
                  thing I'll do is persuade the other investors to withdraw, 
                  sending your little blueship pool crashing down. The second 
                  thing I'll do is put you and your entire newbie corporation on 
                  my kill list, and believe me, you do NOT want to be on my kill 
                  list.&quot; <br>
                  <br>
                  I was about to scream back at him, call him a fat fuck, tell 
                  him he was a worthless piece of shit, anything to express my 
                  intense anger and dislike. But the Great Magnet was looking 
                  down upon me, and the familiar pull dragged me above my rage. 
                  I glimpsed over my shoulder, and saw a girl looking squarely 
                  at me. I was perplexed for a moment, but then I realized, so 
                  was she: here was this guy standing near the erotica section 
                  in short running shorts, talking on a red phone that looks 
                  like it might be used to inform NORAD of an impending nuclear 
                  attack. I did what I could to not laugh, and responded to 
                  Sata, er, Thoggins' question.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;The biggest investor would be me. I've put 180 million isk, 
                  nearly all of my savings, into this deal.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Oh. So if I were to put more than that in, I would not only 
                  get the first copy, but I would get the original blueprint as 
                  well?&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  His deception was thinner than Calista Flockhart's wrists. His 
                  intent was to put in the 200 million, then demand the original 
                  blueprint, possibly obtain it, and make for the hills without 
                  producing so much as a single copy. If he did produce any 
                  copies, I was absolutely certain that they would only be sold 
                  for an exorbitant price.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;That's right.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I'll put 181 million isk in then.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I'm sorry, but there is a required interval of 20 million 
                  credits for any marginal investment increase above 60 million. 
                  If you look, it's in the contract. So if you want to be the 
                  highest investor, you'd have to put in 200 million.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;200 million? You want 200 million you greedy bastard? FINE!&quot; 
                  The recognizable sound of a phone being flung in rapid motion 
                  through the air broadcasted itself into my ear, followed by an 
                  even more recognizable click. My heart raced, my spirit 
                  soared, and a sudden sensation of green enthusiasm overtook 
                  me. I was rich, RICH, <b>RICH BEYOND MY WILDEST DREAMS </b>!
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  I slammed the phone down and turned away, dashing out of the 
                  library into the open day. My cheeks were aflame; my body was 
                  aglow; my limbs were trembling. On and on I strode, far out 
                  over the roads, singing wildly to the sky, crying to greet the 
                  advent of wealth that had cried to me. On and on and on and 
                  on! The possibilities for my newly acquired wealth were 
                  endless! I continued on, walking nowhere, for I had no 
                  destination other than the boundless gates of the infinite.<br>
                  <br>
                  I halted suddenly and heard my heart in the silence. How far 
                  had I walked? What time was it? My stomach churned, and the 
                  whiff of fries hung heavy in the air. A pair of golden arches 
                  loomed in the horizon, their breastlike curves beckoning me 
                  on. My appetite was aroused, and it was time to eat.<br>
                  <br>
                  After my banquet, it would be time to collect.</font></p>
