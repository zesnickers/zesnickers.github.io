                  burned with the heat of a thousand infernos. The Big Mac I had 
                  eaten in celebration of my victory was now tearing its way 
                  through my intestinal lining, one membrane at a time. The 
                  freedom fries supplemented its attack on my stomach walls, 
                  like fighter ships from an enemy carrier. My digestive system 
                  would be triumphant, but not without a fight. The weight in my 
                  stomach grew heavier with each step, but I pressed on. It was 
                  getting dark out, and I had to make it home soon, I had to get 
                  those credits, and I had to make off like a

                  in the night. After a painful march, I arrived. I sat down, 
                  logged onto AIM, and was barraged with a flurry of messages.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  HardHead: Hey, can I wire those credits now? I wanna secure my 
                  spot in the pool. Ive been waiting for you all day, its 
                  about time you got home.<br>
                  <br>
                  Me: Okay, go ahead and do it. Ill be on Eve in a bit to 
                  verify that the credits were sent.<br>
                  <br>
                  Jorpho: Hello. The other investors and I have been waiting for 
                  you; we want to send the isk quickly so you can buy the 
                  blueprint and get to work. If I understand correctly, do you 
                  now have all the isk you need? <br>
                  <br>
                  Me: No; were still 100 million isk short of our goal since 
                  Alltech hasnt come through yet. Ive invested everything I 
                  have into this deal, but I can still borrow up to 40 million 
                  from the members of my corporation. It all depends, I suppose, 
                  on how Alltech votes.<br>
                  <br>
                  Jorpho: Oh, I talked to Magnulus. They were in the process of 
                  voting a few hours ago, I havent heard from him since.<br>
                  <br>
                  Me: Hmm.. Okay, Ill check my email. You can go ahead and wire 
                  the money, Ill be on Eve in a bit.<br>
                  <br>
                  Thoggins: Go into Eve, and Ill send you the isk. Dont do 
                  anything stupid with it, or Ill have to act on my threats. 
                  You have no idea how serious I am about this.<br>
                  <br>
                  Me: Okay.<br>
                  <br>
                  A euphoric daze passed over me briefly as reality dawned anew. 
                  I would be scamming this prick out of his money, out of 200 
                  million of his preciously farmed credits, and he wouldnt be 
                  able to do a damn thing about it. I could envision his 
                  parents house being surrounded by SWAT teams. The county 
                  police chief would be holding a megaphone, shouting into it.<br>
                  <br>
                  Thoggins! COME OUT OF THE BASEMENT NOW WITH YOUR HANDS IN THE 
                  AIR. DO NOT MAKE ANY SUDDEN MOVEMENTS.<br>
                  <br>
                  He would emerge, a short fat man wearing a flowing black 
                  trench coat and dark Oakley sunglasses. His hands would be in 
                  his pockets, and he would loudly proclaim,<br>
                  <br>
                  The library workers are all dead! Dead! They stole my money, 
                  so I killed them with my bare hands, and I will kill all of 
                  you too!<br>
                  <br>
                  He would then start to pull something out of his pocket, and 
                  the entire LAPD SWAT team would open fire on him. The 9 
                  millimeter hollow-point bullets would penetrate his soft flesh 
                  and expand, creating large breaches in each of his vital 
                  organs. They would continue to shoot through his body and exit 
                  out his back, leaving a gaping hole that would spurt out blood 
                  and various torn off chunks of cartilage. They would keep 
                  pumping round after round into his fallen, disfigured mass, 
                  making sure that he was good and dead. And when they finally 
                  got around to investigating the body, they would find out that 
                  he was reaching for a pumped super soaker pistol filled with 
                  laundry detergent.<br>
                  <br>
                  The police chief would then say, Well boys, aint that an ace 
                  in the hole! They would collectively chuckle, raid his house 
                  for small bills, and finish off the day at Scarlets strip 
                  club.<br>
                  <br>
                  I opened up Outlook, eagerly checking for a new email from 
                  Magnulus. Finally, I found it.<br>
                  <br>
                  Dear Nightfreeze,<br>
                  <br>
                  After much debate and reflection, and a narrow vote, my 
                  corporation has decided that it would be in our best interest 
                  to invest in your Apocalypse blueprint pool. Since, as you 
                  repeatedly noted, it will take well over a month for a 60 
                  million credit investor to receive their BP, we have made the 
                  decision to invest 80 million. I have taken the liberty of 
                  wiring this money to you, and I pray that the pool will reach 
                  its goal soon. <br>
                  <br>
                  Best regards,<br>
                  <br>
                  Magnulus<br>
                  <br>
                  I logged into Eve, and saw that I had several messages in my 
                  in-game inbox. I clicked through each of them, and suddenly, 
                  my credit balance jumped from 6 figures to 9. 480 million 
                  credits. It was done! I had joined the greats, and became one 
                  of the illustrious and famed men who would forever live in 
                  Eves history. I was going to live another life, a life devoid 
                  of mining and trading! A life of grace and wealth and 
                  happiness! It was true. It was not a dream from which I would 
                  wake. The past was past. My muddied room now seemed gay, and 
                  in spite of all, I had done it. <br>
                  <br>
                  I transferred the credits to my alternate character, Tachz, 
                  and logged off. Staring at Nightfreezes face in the character 
                  selection screen, I wiped a single tear off my cheek as I 
                  clicked the delete button. <br>
                  I picked up the phone and called Trazir.<br>
                  <br>
                  Hello?<br>
                  <br>
                  Hey man, Ive got some bad news. Are you sitting down?<br>
                  <br>
                  Uh, no, hold on.<br>
                  <br>
                  Seconds passed, and an even greater smile broke out across my 
                  face.<br>
                  <br>
                  Okay, what is it?<br>
                  <br>
                  One of the investors figured out this was a scam. They all 
                  pulled out their money; were basically at ground zero again, 
                  dude.<br>
                  <br>
                  GOD DAMN IT! DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG I WORKED ON THOSE FORUM 
                  POSTS? DO YOU? DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH TIME I WASTED ON THIS 
                  SHIT?<br>
                  <br>
                  Hey man, Im just fucking with you. They all invested their 
                  money, I deleted Nightfreeze, and my Tachz is now the proud 
                  owner of 480 million credits.<br>
                  <br>
                  A powerful silence passed over the phone. I hoped he wasnt 
                  having an asthma attack.<br>
                  <br>
                  You might want to delete your character too man; once they 
                  find out we scammed them, theyre gonna be pissed. Very, very 
                  pissed.<br>
                  <br>
                  Yeah. YEAH. FUCK YEAH. WE DID IT MAN, WE DID IT.<br>
                  <br>
                  I know we did. I know.<br>
                  <br>
                  Now we just had to figure out how to spend it.</font><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">
