                  Bird Gets The Worm&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  I can't think of a better quote to describe Eve Online's 
                  trading system; the key to succeeding as a trader in Eve laid 
                  in being one of the first to login to the newly reset server, 
                  before all the trade routes became exhausted. With this in 
                  mind, I set my alarm clock to 6:30 AM and woke up with a new 
                  purpose in my day, to make as much virtual cash as possible. I 
                  had already planned out some routes during the previous weeks, 
                  so I hit the ground running. My first route involved bringing 
                  computer hardware from the Amarr region into the Gallente 
                  region; this would be about 16 jumps, or the real-time 
                  equivalent of 25 minutes. I bought the hardware for 
                  approximately 1100 credits per unit, and spent all 3 million 
                  credits on it. This amounted to 2700 units of computer 
                  hardware that I would need to sell. My heart pounded with 
                  excitement at the prospect of actually making a real profit in 
                  this God forsaken game.<br>
                  <br>
                  Each space sector in Eve is assigned a security rating; this 
                  rating, ranging from 0.0 all the way to 1.0, determines the 
                  strength and speed with which the intergalactic police 
                  respond. In 0.0 regions, there are no police, and pirates, 
                  both PCs and NPCs, fly around freely, and in 1.0 regions, 
                  security is tighter than Jessica Simpson's snatch. During this 
                  first eventful trade flight of mine, I had to pass through a 
                  0.3 region. At the time, I naively believed that anything 
                  above 0.0 would be safe, because nobody would be ballsy enough 
                  to dare provoke the wrath of the 5-0 in space. I turned out to 
                  be wrong; not dead wrong, but pretty fucking close.<br>
                  <br>
                  I knew that something was wrong when my ship started to beep 
                  and a red target lock cursor appeared in the horizon with the 
                  name &quot;Dethbringer&quot;. The beeping accelerated and a red square 
                  appeared around my ship. Since I hadn't even bothered trying 
                  to fight a training pirate yet, I had no idea what the hell 
                  was going on. He sent a message to me, &quot;250k or die.&quot; I 
                  responded to him, &quot;okay&quot;, the sweat dripping down my armpits, 
                  past my side, and accumulating in a little puddle at the edge 
                  of my shirt. Five or more seconds must have passed as I 
                  fumbled for the MWD hotkey, and just as they started to warm 
                  up, the first missile slammed into my ship. The warpgate was 
                  15,000 meters away, I had to be within 800 meters to pass 
                  through it, and I was currently flying at about 300 meters per 
                  second. A second missile exploded against the hull, bringing 
                  down my shields and tearing apart my hull. I knew that if one 
                  more missile hit me, my ship would be nothing more than space 
                  debris, and this fucker who couldn't even spell &quot;Death&quot; 
                  correctly would have access to all I had worked for. &quot;COME ON 
                  YOU FUCKING PIECES OF SHIT&quot;, I shouted at the monitor. My dog 
                  started to bark in the background, but I could barely hear it. 
                  The only thing that mattered was the gate, because I knew that 
                  if I had lost that cargo, all my weeks of hard work and all my 
                  finely tuned bullshit would be down the drain.<br>
                  <br>
                  WHOOOOOOSH. I hadn't used the MWDs since the night before, and 
                  forgot about just how powerful they were. I was now shooting 
                  towards the warp gate at 3.5 kilometers/second, and all 
                  Dethbringer had to account for his two expensive missiles was 
                  a trail of dust. If you're reading this right now, Deth, I'd 
                  like to give out a hearty Fuck You. <br>
                  <br>
                  I arrived at the specified starbase in the Gallente region, my 
                  ship battered and bruised, and my ego several sizes smaller. I 
                  sold the computer hardware for a total of 3.7 million credits. 
                  The hull repairs amounted to 100k. I felt my heart with my 
                  left hand; it was still pulsing rapidly, and the realization 
                  that I netted 600,000 credits in 25 minutes, along with a 
                  healthy dose of action, sent it shooting up even further. I 
                  did several more trade routes that morning, and by 9 AM, my 
                  credit count read &quot;5,780,000 credits&quot;. I knew that both Trazir 
                  and HardHead were gonna cream their pants when they saw this, 
                  but for now, I had to go to class. <br>
