                  <font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" color="white">All I could 
                  think about during the day was returning to Eve. Calculus 
                  equations, physics problems, the musings of long-dead authors, 
                  all these things meant nothing to me now, for I was well on my 
                  way to becoming a virtual pimp. I drove home like a maniac 
                  that day, darting in and out of traffic and speeding through 
                  crowded city intersections. I sprinted to my computer and 
                  started Eve, my heart warming at the gentle glow of the galaxy 
                  sun. I netted about 1.5 million more credits by 7 PM, when 
                  HardHead logged on. He wasted no time in messaging me.<br>
                  <br>
                  HH: &quot;Hey dood, how's it going? How's the financial situation?&quot;<br>
                  Me: &quot;Pretty fucking awesome, I've made 5 million credits so 
                  far.&quot;<br>
                  HH: &quot;Are you kidding me? Jesus Christ that's a lot, can I have 
                  my money <br>
                  back?&quot;<br>
                  Me: &quot;Sure. I'll give you a million extra too, just as 
                  promised.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  HardHead logged in, and I wired him 4 million credits. His 
                  trust in me was now firmly established, and I got back to 
                  work, doing what I did best, running trade routes. During this 
                  time, Trazir bitched and moaned, asking me to wire him money 
                  so that he too could start doing trade routes. He even called 
                  me up a few times, asking for virtual money. I eventually gave 
                  in and sent him a million just to shut him up. By the time I 
                  went to sleep that night, having made an additional 500k by 
                  whoring large amounts of cheap items through safe areas, I 
                  knew that my virtual life had changed forever.<br>
                  <br>
                  Over the next two weeks, I traded harder than a Chinaman in a 
                  flea market. Trazir even joined in, but since he was too lazy 
                  to wake up early in the morning, he would be lucky on his best 
                  days to make half what I made on my worst days. During this 
                  time, HardHead told me about how he had moved on to actually 
                  writing scripts for the game so that he could find and mine 
                  the very rarest of asteroids with ease. I also became a master 
                  of blasting off with my MWDs the second any hostiles showed up 
                  near a warp gate, and while there were a few close calls, 
                  nothing ever rivalled my experience with Dethbringer. By the 
                  end of this period, I was worth close to 85 million credits, 
                  and Trazir was near 30 million. I felt like a fucking space 
                  tycoon, a financial juggernaut, ready to expand my realm of 
                  influence from the monetary to the military. I was going to 
                  buy a cruiser, the next step up from the frigate you are given 
                  when you first enter the world of Eve. <br>
                  <br>
                  I did my research, and decided that the best ship for combat 
                  would be the Caldari Moa; it was fast, deadly, and had an 
                  armament approximately equal to the United States missile 
                  arsenal during the Cold War. Nuclear winter, here I come. I 
                  was going to pick it up from a guy named OneEye Willie, a 
                  hard boiled manufacturing magnate I met one day in IRC. Willie 
                  sold the ship equivalent of an Alienware computer; terribly 
                  overpriced, but outfitted with all the best decals, all the 
                  best hardware, and most importantly, the best weaponry that 
                  money could buy. When you bought from Willie, you werent just 
                  buying a combat ship; you were buying death incarnate, a 
                  million credits at a time.<br>
                  <br>
                  After an intense bout of haggling, some shouting on my part, 
                  and some screaming back on his, I worked him down to 35 
                  million credits. Willie, in addition to being just a little 
                  eccentric, manufactured his ships far away from civilization 
                  where costs were lower and competition was nil. I suspected 
                  that he supplied pirates with their combat ships, but I never 
                  could confirm it, because Willie never, ever talked about 
                  himself or his other clients. I would pick up the Moa in some 
                  near-abandoned outpost in a 0.0 sector in the Caldari region. 
                  It would take me 2 hours to fly out there, but I wanted that 
                  fucking ship, so it was worth it. Since it would be 0.0 space, 
                  and since I didnt want to have to leave my indie out in the 
                  middle of the space equivalent of Bumfuck, Alaska, I would be 
                  flying out in my lifepod.<br>
                  <br>
                  In Eve Online, your lifepod is the final string in the cold 
                  vacuum of space which keeps you in the world of the living. 
                  Unfortunately, its about as strong as an anorexic midget in a 
                  world of steroid-laced giants. NPC enemies ignore lifepods 
                  completely, but the NPCs were easy to get away from anyway. It 
                  was the other humans you had to watch out for, the asshole 
                  player killers who destroyed lifepods and set you back hours, 
                  not for profit, not for personal gain, just for the sake of 
                  ruining somebodys day.<br>
                  <br>
                  I had been gliding through space for about 90 minutes when I 
                  saw the red targeting cursor. My pod beeped, and I shouted at 
                  the monitor, FUCKING DAMN IT! Seconds passed, and I was 
                  perplexed; no missiles had hit my pod, and no lasers blasts 
                  were ripping through my hull. My speed bar was decreasing. 400 
                  m/s. 300 m/s. 200 m/s. I slowly grinded to a halt. Your 
                  engines have been disabled, the notification read. His name 
                  was DanielSan, and he had me immobilized in space. My life was 
                  in the hands of the fucking karate kid.<br>
                  <br>
                  His message arrived shortly after, give me 500k or Im gonna 
                  blow you to shit.<br>
                  <br>
                  All right, calm down, Ill wire the money right now. I 
                  groped for the send button, nervously trying to type in 
                  500,000 in the wire transfer box. The way I figured it, giving 
                  up the profits from a single 30 minute trade run more than 
                  justified the loss of skills and time I would have incurred if 
                  I was blown away.<br>
                  <br>
                  A second before the wire went through, I received another 
                  message: send it NOW you bitch. Heres a little present. A 
                  single laser blast tore through the mass of my ship, bringing 
                  my hull integrity down to 15%. Ok, you can leave now bitch, 
                  and dont come back. Thirty seconds later, my engines let out 
                  a low whine as they came back to life. Once again, I had 
                  narrowly evaded death at the hands of a malevolent prick with 
                  a dumb name. My engines were damaged and on fire, only 
                  operating at 1/3 capacity. My ship hobbled through space 
                  towards the jump gate, beads of sweat broke out on my forehead 
                  with each additional meter; I feared that the karate kid would 
                  pull the equivalent of a Mr. Miyagi finishing move by blowing 
                  me the fuck up. As I passed through the warp gate, I vowed my 
                  revenge, and 60 minutes later, I arrived at Willies, a 
                  broken, burning shell of a man.<br>
                  <br>
                  Bout time you got here. Man, what the hell were you doing 
                  anyways? You said it would be 2 hours.<br>
                  <br>
                  I got into a little accident. Can I see the ship?<br>
                  <br>
                  He placed the Moa in a trading window, and it was just as 
                  beautiful as I envisioned it. It had 3 long-distance laser 
                  racks, 2 high density missile bays, and an ECM ray to drain 
                  enemies of their ships energy. I gave Willie the money, and 
                  within minutes, I was flying away from Willies base in a 
                  shiny new Moa. I had a good idea of who my first target would 
                  be, and I was shooting through space with a rage I hadnt felt 
                  in weeks. The familiar explosion of the MWDs sent me roaring, 
                  closer and closer, towards each warp gate. He was minutes 
                  away, I could feel it in my bones, and I burned with a rage 
                  equal to that of the galactic sun. <br>
                  <br>
                  And finally, I knew it. He was one jump away, and I was only a 
                  kilometer from the warp gate. He would be on the other side, 
                  camping, bullying, killing, waiting for another innocent soul 
                  to pass through his dark grasp. I loaded up my missile bays, 
                  readied my left hand over my weaponry hotkeys, my right hand 
                  over my targeting hotkey; this was gonna be one hell of a 
                  fight, and it didnt help much that it was going to be the 
                  first time I ever fired a weapon in Eve. I nervously gulped 
                  and passed through.</font><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" color="white"><br>
