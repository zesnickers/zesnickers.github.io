                  <font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" color="white">The heat was 
                  on. My targeting system had Danielsan acquired, and I 
                  activated my MWDs; I would unload on that motherfucker with 
                  the wrath of the Cobra Kai after the halloween party. I 
                  quickly reached firing range, and let loose with both 
                  missiles. They glided through the air gracefully, passing 
                  through each others white trails like two avian lovers mating 
                  in flight. The ensuing explosions annihilated his shields and 
                  did significant damage to his hull. Oh yes, he would be mine. 
                  He fired back pitifully, his laser volley barely denting me 
                  thanks to my shield booster. I let out a cackle of delight as 
                  I pressed the &quot;fire laser&quot; hotkey, and watched his ship 
                  disappear in an inferno. Payback wasn't mine yet, though. I 
                  fired my ECM ray on his pod, draining it of all its energy and 
                  effectively keeping him from engaging his hyperdrive. I knew 
                  it would take about 20 seconds for his pods' capacitor level 
                  to reach the point again where he could enter hyperspace, so I 
                  wasted no time in messaging.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Give me 750k or I will pod you, bitch.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Seconds later, the money appeared in my credit box. I was 
                  contented now, but not quite happy. For a moment, my left 
                  index finger wavered over the fire missile hotkey as my 
                  conscience actually questioned whether or not I should blow 
                  this fucker up. The two burning hot streaks ejected themselves 
                  from my ship, furiously shooting towards their target, and 5 
                  seconds later, Danielsan was no more. He didn't bother 
                  messaging me after that; he knew that he had done wrong, and 
                  that the Great Magnet had effected its will upon him. I flew 
                  back towards civilized space, happy and gleeful and free.<br>
                  <br>
                  I regaled Trazir with my story that night, saying that he 
                  needed to get a cruiser as fast as fucking possible, for the 
                  thrill of a fight and the joyous feeling of seeing your 
                  enemies slain before you was rivalled by nothing in this God 
                  forsaken game. He agreed, but bitched about fiscal problems; 
                  apparently he'd done a few bad trade routes where he actually 
                  ended up selling his acquired goods for less than he bought 
                  them. How this happened, I do not know. Out of the goodness of 
                  my heart, I wired him 2 million. Classes had ended for both of 
                  us by this point, and Trazir overcame his natural laziness, 
                  not by waking up extremely early like me, but by going to bed 
                  extremely late. He would sleep during the day, jerk off during 
                  the night, and wait until the servers came up at 7 AM to start 
                  doing his trade routes. Within a week, he was worth 60 million 
                  credits, and I was nearing the same. But then, one morning 
                  after I logged in, it happened.<br>
                  <br>
                  I was running my trade routes as usual, when I came upon a 
                  pirate named Lando Griffin. No big deal, I thought to myself, 
                  just hit the MWD key and blast off towards the gate.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Your ship does not have a sufficient amount of energy to use 
                  that.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;WHAT THE FUCK?&quot; I slammed my finger into the MWD hotkey 
                  again; this must be some sort of joke, some temporary bug in 
                  the game.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Your ship does not have a sufficient amount of energy to use 
                  that.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  The bullets from his machinegun pinged off my shields, doing 
                  considerably damage, and I knew it was only a matter of time. 
                  I watched in terror and heartache as my ship slowly cruised 
                  towards the warp gate; each bullet into its side was like a 
                  cut into my heart. I was carrying 30 million credits worth of 
                  goods, and I was NOT going to let those goods be destroyed. My 
                  only hope was to try and enter hyperspace, try and get away, 
                  try ANYTHING to recover my money. But alas, a moment before my 
                  finger stroked the hyper-drive hotkey, his ECM ray drained my 
                  ship of its energy. I messaged Lando, desperate for survival.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I'll give you 5 million credits if you let me go. PLEASE 
                  MAN.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  He responded with a dual-volley of Phalanx Rockets. My 
                  formidably armored industrial ship was now on fire, each lick 
                  graphical lick of flame consuming the last vestiges of my 
                  morning optimism. I was dead now, and I knew it. I 
                  force-ejected from my ship, hoping that he wouldn't destroy it 
                  if it was unoccupied. My pod hovered in space, like a small 
                  child seperated from its parent. I jammed my finger into the 
                  hyperspace key, and moments later, I blasted off into the 
                  stars. By the time I was tens of kilometers away, I saw a 
                  small speck of light in the galactic horizon. The fucker had 
                  destroyed my ship.<br>
                  <br>
                  I wasted no time in calling Trazir on the phone. A few days 
                  earlier, he had purchased a cruiser of his own, one that I 
                  knew was just as powerful or even more powerful than my own. 
                  It was an Amarr Maller, a ship with more combat slots on it 
                  than a fucking space station. He told me that the purchasing 
                  price was 40 million, so I knew that unless he got ripped the 
                  fuck off, which was quite possible for him, each of those 
                  slots possessed a piece of ordnance capable of ending a star 
                  system. I flew back to my Moa, which was about 15 jumps away 
                  in Caldari space, and had him meet me there. We were going to 
                  exact revenge, and unless Lando had Han Solo and the entire 
                  rebel armada with him, he was going to have the space 
                  equivalent of dry, painful prison rape.<br>
                  <br>
                  About an hour later, we arrived at the space sector where I 
                  had been attacked. We were on the phone with each other, which 
                  made instant communication possible, and I hoped that this 
                  would tilt the advantage in our favor if Lando had any other 
                  pirates with him.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Listen,&quot; I said, &quot;If there's more than one, I'll call out a 
                  target, and we both unload on him. Focus fire. Open up with 
                  missiles, keep the pressure on with lasers, and once you think 
                  his hull is at about 50%, fire your ECM.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Okay, but what if one of us gets badly damaged?&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Fight to the death. We need to rid the game of these kinds of 
                  scum.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  We engaged our hyperdrives and darted towards the jump gate 
                  where I had been destroyed. Vengeance would be mine, and my 
                  foes would rue the day that they crossed me. Or so I thought.</font><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" color="white"><br>
