                  <font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" color="white">I watched the 
                  stars dash past my Moa with a new perspective. This could be 
                  the last time I'll ever see this Moa, I thought. I knew that 
                  Lando probably had friends with him, since pirates very rarely 
                  operate alone for long in 0.2 space. I also knew that Trazir's 
                  combat prowess was meager at best. The Great Magnet would have 
                  to be on our side if we were gonna win this one, and so far, I 
                  hadn't been feeling much pull today. <br>
                  <br>
                  My engines let out their dull, familiar whimper as they 
                  disengaged from hyperdrive mode. Four red crosses appeared 
                  about 20 km away, and my ship started beeping like a NORAD 
                  siren on Defcon 1. And there among them was Lando, cowering in 
                  the middle of their formation like a soldier hiding behind a 
                  field of mines. <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Ok man, cycle your target to Lando, fire your missiles, and 
                  MWD to 15 kilos.&quot; As I said this, my own jet-powered 
                  implements of destruction set off from my ship and whisked 
                  through the vacuum of space, gyrating to their dance of death 
                  as they made their way towards Lando. I moved the camera to 
                  Trazir's ship, and aside from his pitifully slow forward 
                  movement, nothing seemed to be happening.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;What the fuck? FIRE YOUR MISSILES.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Silence.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;FIRE YOUR MISSILES MAN, WHY AREN'T YOU FIRING YOUR MISSILES?&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I uh... I forgot to load the ammo into the missile bays. It's 
                  loading now.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  By now, all four pirates had noticed our presence and my 
                  presents to Lando had detonated on his hull and ripped apart 
                  his shields. I pressed the MWD hotkey, but once again, I 
                  received the hellish message.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Your ship does not have a sufficient amount of energy to use 
                  that.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;GOD DAMN IT.&quot; I slammed the phone receiver against the wall; 
                  in order for my lasers to work at their optimum damage level, 
                  I would have to fire them from a precise range of 15 
                  kilometers. Since I was 20 kilos away, they would be doing 
                  about 75% of their maximum potential damage. Since this was a 
                  2v4, since Trazir was out of action until his fucking missiles 
                  were loaded, and since I saw the white streaks of enemy 
                  rockets racing towards my hull, I did what any man in a 
                  cornered position would do. <br>
                  <br>
                  I went berserk.<br>
                  <br>
                  I worked my keyboard like a Japanese chef on crack. After 
                  several laser volleys, I could see Lando's engines turn red; 
                  they were on fire, and in a few moments, he would be as well. 
                  My missiles let off a thundrous wave as they paraded and 
                  jigged, rolling towards Lando's cheaply built ship. And then, 
                  they hit. My shields went down almost immediately in a 
                  brilliant glare as 4 enemy rockets erupted against my precious 
                  Moa.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;FUCK,&quot; I shouted into Trazir's ear. &quot;DO SOMETHING DAMN IT.&quot; I 
                  could almost feel his anxiety emanating through the phone 
                  cord, and an instant later I breathed a sigh of relief as his 
                  ECM ray sucked the energy out of Lando's capacitors. And then, 
                  there was a brief flare as my missile discharged and the body 
                  of his ship broke apart in a million different directions. A 
                  second later, my other missile ignited in the then-empty space 
                  that once contained Lando's ship. However, his pod was only 
                  meters away, and this explosion was sufficient to blow it to 
                  smithereens. I snickered ecstatically, for revenge had been 
                  mine, and I could now die with honor. The lasers burned into 
                  my hull, damaging my engines and slowing my ship down to a 
                  crawl. I cycled through the remaining pirates like a game show 
                  contestant spinning a wheel of chance. The spinner landed on 
                  some prick named Johanesan.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Okay, focus fire on Johanesan&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  I could almost hear war drums in the background as I targeted 
                  him and fired my laser volley. They had been moving towards us 
                  as we moved towards them, and the engagement range was now 
                  close to 17000 meters; my lasers would now do substantially 
                  more damage to the enemy shields. To my delight, Trazir had 
                  actually figured out how to use his armaments, and I watched 
                  in elation as his missiles streamed through the void, going 
                  straight for Johanesan's armor. Another laser volley splashed 
                  against my aegis, and my ship caught fire. I shot off one last 
                  barrage of missiles at Johanesan before I force ejected and 
                  began to take off with my pod.<br>
                  <br>
                  But I was too late. <br>
                  <br>
                  The rockets blasted my 35 million credit toy into nothing, and 
                  the resulting conflagration decimated my pod. In my naivety, I 
                  had neglected to purchase good insurance, which set my skill 
                  gains back by about 3 weeks, and I had also neglected to 
                  change the spawn point of my clone if I ever died. As a 
                  result, I reappeared back in the newbie sector of Caldari 
                  space, a place I hadn't seen in months.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Finish off Johan and get the hell out of there, dude.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;It's already done, those last missiles of yours took him 
                  down. I'm hyperspacing away as we speak.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  I made some excuse about having to go eat dinner, and hung up 
                  the phone.<br>
                  <br>
                  And then, it hit me. My 35 million credit ship was gone 
                  forever. OneEye Willie would build me a new one, I knew this, 
                  but his base was 5 hours away from where I was stationed, and 
                  I sure as hell didn't feel like watching a shitty newbie ship 
                  fly for that long. I logged off Eve in disgust, and read 
                  through the lengthy list of patch notes that morning, looking 
                  for some explanation of why my MWDs didn't work.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;The capacitor requirements for Microwarp Drives have been 
                  substantially increased.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Fuck. <br>
                  <br>
                  I logged onto the Eve forums, and learned that pirates and 
                  player killers, who comprise a substantial portion of Eve's 
                  population, had been bitching to the game developers that MWDs 
                  allowed industrial ships to get away too easily, and that they 
                  should be nerfed so the pirates could gank an honest trader 
                  trying to make a profit. In response, the genius developers of 
                  Eve put insane energy requirements on MWDs; in order to use 
                  them, you would need to be running a barebones gimp ship, 
                  which meant that if you were flying an industrial ship, you 
                  couldn't have any cargo expanders.<br>
                  <br>
                  Using an indie without cargo expanders is like running a high 
                  powered train with only one boxcar. Not only is it stupid, and 
                  not only does it look ridiculous, but it is also highly 
                  unprofitable. This was the straw that broke the camel's back. 
                  I had grown tired of trading and mindless profiteering. Not 
                  only was I bored, I was pissed. Pissed at every idiot who 
                  played Eve and thought it was fun to watch pebbles float into 
                  their ships for hours on end. Pissed at the developers for 
                  taking away my MWDs. Pissed at the world.<br>
                  <br>
                  As I browsed through the various forums, I noticed a fair 
                  number of investment threads; various corporations and 
                  individuals who offered to pool people's money in order to buy 
                  a ship blueprint, which could be copied and passed out to each 
                  investor, so if somebody put money in the pool, he would 
                  receive his own copy of the blueprint. This intrigued me. I 
                  decided to log back in to scroll through the help menus and 
                  see how blueprints worked, but on my way in, I noticed a patch 
                  message.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;We would like to remind the players of Eve Online that game 
                  masters are unable to assist players who have been involved in 
                  any sort of scam. We have taken measures to prevent scamming 
                  by making it easier for corporations to see exactly who has 
                  access to the shipyards and equipment pools, but it is up to 
                  the officers of the corporation themselves to ensure that they 
                  fully trust the individuals they recruit.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  I called Trazir again and told him about the things I had just 
                  read. We had a nice long talk, and our planning commenced.</font><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" color="white"><br>
