                  <font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" color="white">The 
                  possibilities were tremendous. I could think of so many 
                  potential ways to make an unethical profit that it made my 
                  head hurt, and for once, I welcomed the pulsing pain. Horatio 
                  Algers spirit was alive that day, and I reveled in it. Since 
                  trading, our only source of income, was now so dangerous that 
                  it would be fruitless over a long term period of time, neither 
                  Trazir nor I had any moral qualms about screwing somebody else 
                  out of their money. After all, it was a dog eat dog universe, 
                  and the only ones who made it to the top were the ones who did 
                  so by any means possible. <br>
                  <br>
                  Listen, I said, I think the best way for us to make money 
                  is to do one of these blueprint schemes. For battleships, the 
                  blueprints cost hundreds of millions of credits man. Hundreds 
                  of millions! With a couple hundred million each, we could live 
                  like kings.<br>
                  <br>
                  Well, maybe, Trazir responded, but come on. Do you think 
                  people are gonna just give us their money? I mean, just like 
                  that, with nothing more than a promise in return?<br>
                  <br>
                  Thats exactly what I think. I did it once already, remember? 
                  In this case, well just be doing it with more than one 
                  person. And in my opinion, the key to pulling this off will be 
                  to build credibility.<br>
                  <br>
                  I dunno man, but if youre right, then I think wed better 
                  start a corporation. Nobodys gonna give their credits to a 
                  couple of space bums.<br>
                  <br>
                  Okay, I said, Im going to go learn more about how these 
                  blueprints work. Ill call you back some time tonight. <br>
                  <br>
                  The premise of blueprint investing was to be able to buy what 
                  would normally be a super-expensive blueprint for a much 
                  cheaper price. A group of people would give their money to one 
                  trustworthy person, and that person would then purchase the 
                  blueprint and make copies of it. These copies would be given 
                  out to each of the investors, who could then build a ship 
                  using their newly acquired blueprint. <br>
                  <br>
                  I delved into help menus, game tutorials, and informational 
                  websites, learning as much as I possibly could about 
                  blueprints and the related skills I would need in order to 
                  persuade people to invest in me. I finally decided that our 
                  blueprint would be the Apocalypse battleship. I had seen it in 
                  combat once before, and it lived up to its namesake, blasting 
                  away 4 heavily armed cruisers in less than 30 seconds. 
                  However, it was also the most expensive blueprint of all, with 
                  an original copy weighing in at 1.125 billion credits to 
                  purchase off the market. <br>
                  <br>
                  It would be an unrealistic stretch to tell potential investors 
                  that I had the maximum amount of skill level in each of the 
                  skills needed to upgrade a blueprint and copy that blueprint. 
                  So I figured that I would lie, and tell them that some of 
                  these skills were fully trained by my associates, and the rest 
                  of them were fully trained on my other account (which didnt 
                  exist).<br>
                  <br>
                  Trazir was right, though. The only way to successfully 
                  persuade somebody to invest in us was to make ourselves look 
                  as legitimate as humanly possible. To this end, we started our 
                  corporation, and I took an unnecessary risk by naming it ZZZZ 
                  Best (google the name). He didnt catch the joke, and 
                  luckily, neither did any of the future investors. There was 
                  just one problem: the corporation only had two members. If a 
                  prospective investor looked us up, a corporation with two 
                  members would appear to be highly suspicious. With this in 
                  mind, we did what any company with dreams of wealth and 
                  splendor would do.<br>
                  <br>
                  We went on a recruiting drive.<br>
                  <br>
                  Trazir would fly around the Minmatar newbie sectors, offering 
                  10,000 credits to anybody who would join our corporation. All 
                  they had to do was click on accept when Trazir made the 
                  offer, and they became a part of our corporate family. Since 
                  many of the people he encountered were only days, hours, or 
                  even minutes new to Eve, a great deal clicked accept and 
                  were subsequently given 10,000 credits. I did the same in the 
                  Caldari newbie regions, and within a couple days, ZZZZ Best 
                  was burgeoning at the seams with 18 clueless members. We had 
                  to act quickly and peddle our deal, as well as maintain member 
                  numbers, because there would no doubt be a good deal of 
                  turnover as people realized that they belonged to a 
                  corporation which did nothing for them and which they did 
                  nothing for.<br>
                  <br>
                  We wrote up posts on virtually every Eve forum imaginable, 
                  presenting ourselves as a professional trading organization 
                  which wanted to broker a battleship deal for the good of the 
                  galaxy. We were tired of being pushed around by space pirates, 
                  losing unimaginable amounts of credits for no reason at all 
                  other than greed and misanthropy. To the greater community, we 
                  appeared to be the most benevolent, respectable capitalists 
                  around, and I was fully confident that investment offers would 
                  pile up within days.<br>
                  <br>
                  I messaged HardHead that night about what we were doing; I had 
                  kept in sporadic contact with him, and I felt that he had a 
                  good deal of admiration for me.<br>
                  <br>
                  Me: Hey man, heres the deal. Trazir and I have made a 
                  shitload of money from trading; hell, we even started our own 
                  trading corporation, and were tired of making money. We want 
                  some fucking action. Were both gonna put up 250 million for 
                  an Apocalypse battleship blueprint. Are you interested?<br>
                  <br>
                  HardHead: I already have a Maller. Why would I want a 
                  battleship?<br>
                  <br>
                  Me: Heh. Heres a screenshot series in case youve never seen 
                  one in action.<br>
                  <br>
                  I sent him a zip file of 10 jpegs that some pirate posted on 
                  the eve-i.com forums. It showcased his Scorpion going up 
                  against 3 cruisers. By the end of the series, his shields are 
                  only at 40%, and all the enemy cruisers have been destroyed.<br>
                  <br>
                  Me: Listen bro, Im telling you about this and giving you 
                  first dibs because I consider you a friend, and because you 
                  loaned me money when I was starting out. If you dont wanna 
                  invest, I would understand completely. Why dont you think 
                  about it? Anyways, Im gonna go catch some sleep, talk to you 
                  tomorrow.<br>
                  <br>
                  I logged off and walked over to my bed. The groundwork had 
                  been laid, and stage one was complete.</font><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" color="white"><br>
