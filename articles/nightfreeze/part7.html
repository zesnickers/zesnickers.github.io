                  <font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" color="white">The sun was 
                  dazzling through my window when I woke up some time in the 
                  afternoon. I opened my window and inhaled the fresh air, glad 
                  that it was such a beautiful day outside. I gazed for a moment 
                  more outside my apartment at the luminous lake, taking in the 
                  view for one final instant. I then closed the window and 
                  pulled down the shades, insulating the room in a dark cloak. 
                  Virtual profit has no time for things like nature and 
                  sunshine. I opened up Trillian and Outlook Express; I knew 
                  that I would have to be as accommodating as possible with my 
                  chat programs, leaving them on at all hours in case any 
                  prospective investors tried to contact me. I scoured my inbox 
                  for emails related to ZZZZ Best, but alas, all I received was 
                  the usual &quot;DO YOU WANT A BIGGER PEN IS 1jASDJXJ@!#FD&quot; crap. 
                  For a few seconds, I pouted malcontentedly, then perked up as 
                  I remembered my conversation with HardHead. Surely, he would 
                  have an answer to my generous offer!<br>
                  <br>
                  I rummaged through my ICQ contact list, scrolling through the 
                  hundreds of useless people in search of the one who could make 
                  me richer than Bill Gates. Unfortunately, his name was in red, 
                  which meant he was logged off. Perhaps I can discuss business 
                  with Trazir then, I thought. I scrolled down through the names 
                  to T. <br>
                  <br>
                  Red.<br>
                  <br>
                  I was quickly becoming annoyed at the inactivity which was 
                  occurring beyond my control. The fishing net had been cast far 
                  and wide, I knew this, but the hardest part was waiting for 
                  the fish to entangle themselves. For the first time in weeks, 
                  I got up from my computer, walked out of my house, and 
                  socialized with people I hadn't seen outside of class in 
                  months.<br>
                  <br>
                  I returned some time late that night, my vision blurry, my 
                  head spinning, and my bowels blaring. My once heroic alcohol 
                  tolerance had been reduced to that of a 6 year old child's 
                  over the course of playing Eve for months on end. I moved 
                  towards my computer, but quickly realized that the bathroom 
                  would be a more appropriate place for me at that moment. After 
                  discharging the contents of my stomach, I was strangely 
                  invigorated. My moment of elation quickly dissipated, though, 
                  as I checked my inbox for messages about ZZZZ Best and found 
                  naught but more Viagra ads. I collapsed on my couch and sulked 
                  myself to sleep.<br>
                  <br>
                  This process repeated itself for the next several days, minus 
                  the alcohol. No emails, no instant messages, no HardHead, no 
                  Trazir. My world had been travelling at hyperspace speed, a 
                  billion miles per hour, and for some inexplicable reason it 
                  all stopped. Maybe the Great Magnet was exerting its pull on 
                  me, using this respite as a warning to keep me from continuing 
                  on, to keep me from disrupting and quite possibly destroying 
                  the fragile equilibrium of Eve's economy.<br>
                  <br>
                  Or maybe I had just been drinking too much coffee.<br>
                  <br>
                  I decided to give Trazir a call and see just what the hell he 
                  was up to. He sounded pretty bad.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Hel..&quot; *COUGH* &quot;Hello?&quot; He moaned.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;What the hell man? Are you sick?&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Yeah dude, I've been feeling kind of bad. That's why I 
                  haven't been on lately if you're wondering.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Have you gotten any responses yet for our little deal?&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Uh... Lemme check.&quot; An eternity passed as I waited for him to 
                  ferret through his inbox, which doubtlessly had more junk in 
                  it than a typical Brooklyn Street. &quot;Sorry man, I don't see 
                  anything.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;God damn it, do you know how long it's been dude? Those 
                  message board threads we posted are probably at the bottom of 
                  the heap by now, and the other guy I was telling you about 
                  went AWOL. I think we need to step it up, BIG TIME.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Well, I agree. What do you think we should do?&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  I pondered this query for more than a few seconds. It was the 
                  $64000 question, and the wrong answer would lead to heartache 
                  and waste. Finally, I responded.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I remember reading a story once about this guy who worked as 
                  an attorney during the summer, right after he graduated from 
                  law school. He was working in the California area, and all the 
                  law firms there had reached an agreement to pay the law 
                  students $500 less per week than they normally would have. 
                  This guy somehow found out about the dastardly pay he would be 
                  receiving, and created a bunch of accounts on AOL. He posted 
                  in the California lawyer forums and started a huge flame war 
                  with himself; he used the various accounts to argue both sides 
                  of the issue, and changed up his writing style for each 
                  account name. He dragged other, real people into this flame 
                  war, and the controversy became so great that the law firms 
                  eventually gave in and raised the pay back to its normal 
                  level.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Interesting... Very interesting. So what do you think we 
                  should do?&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;We're gonna go undercover, man, like the fucking CIA. And 
                  we're gonna hype the hell out of this investment deal on every 
                  Eve forum that was ever made. And we're gonna do it using 
                  hotmail accounts for our registration email addresses, so I 
                  suggest that you get out a legal pad and start coming up with 
                  hotmail account names and passwords. I'm personally gonna 
                  register 25 hotmail accounts tonight, and I hope you do the 
                  same. I'll call you back tomorrow, and we'll start posting 
                  like a couple crack whores on crack.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Crack whores on crack? What the fuck does that mean?&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Never mind. Go and start registering dude,&quot; I responded. I 
                  hung up the phone and got to work.</font><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" color="white"><br>
