                  worked, like a couple of crack whores on crack. We hit just 
                  about every message board related to Eve, and we hit them 
                  hard, using the newly created accounts to question our main 
                  accounts about just why somebody should invest in our little 
                  scam. Our two main accounts would then give beautifully 
                  crafted answers to the deceptively easy questions asked by the 
                  new accounts. A common reply-answer-reply scenario consisted 
                  of something like the following:<br>
                  <br>
                  New Account: This deal sounds very interesting, but I'd like 
                  to know, how do you expect people with a low amount of isk to 
                  invest in a battleship? And why should I put my hard earned 
                  money in this deal? How can I trust you?<br>
                  <br>
                  Me: New Account, I appreciate your interest and I will address 
                  each of your excellent questions point by point. Firstly, this 
                  investment pool isn't meant for people who just started 
                  playing Eve a couple weeks ago; this is meant for hardened 
                  players with a significant amount of cash who want to bring 
                  their game one step further with the best battleship in the 
                  entire Eve universe. However, don't start thinking that this 
                  necessarily excludes new or credit-strapped players. If you 
                  are new or low on money, and you are also a part of a 
                  corporation, tell your CEO to check out this thread or contact 
                  me at [Contact info]. I have personally witnessed the awesome 
                  power of a battleship in combat; hell, that was the reason why 
                  I started this investment deal
                  <img src="smile.gif.html" border="0" width="15" height="15">. 
                  If you ask any veteran fighter pilot or pirate, they will tell 
                  you that a single Apocalypse is capable of taking down 4 
                  heavily armed cruisers with ease.<br>
                  <br>
                  Me (cont): And as for why you should put your hard earned 
                  money into this pool, well, just think about the deal before 
                  you right now. You can have a blueprint copy of the BEST ship 
                  in the game for as low as 60 million credits. A normal copy of 
                  the blueprint costs 1.125 BILLION isk on the market. To my 
                  knowledge, there has not yet been a well-organized battleship 
                  blueprint deal of this magnitude, and I highly doubt that 
                  there will be another deal like this for a while. Furthermore, 
                  and I'm sorry to say this, but we are unable to accept 
                  investment contributions below the 60 million minimum, because 
                  the lengthy copy time of the blueprint (6 days with maximum 
                  skill in Science), would mean that the investors on the low 
                  end would have to wait an inordinate amount of time to receive 
                  their blueprints. However, as an incentive to invest more, any 
                  entity (person or corporation) that contributes more than 120 
                  million isk will receive a SECOND copy of the blueprint after 
                  all the investors have received their first; this second copy 
                  will be fully upgraded with a maximum level of production 
                  efficiency. This means that your battleships will not only be 
                  cheaper to build off the blueprint, but they will also build 
                  more quickly as well!<br>
                  <br>
                  Me(cont): To your last question, well, you can ask any of the 
                  17 active and profitable traders in my corporation, ZZZZ Best, 
                  to vouch for my trust. Or you can ask one of the ops in 
                  #eve-online on irc.afraidyet.net; I'm friends with most of 
                  them, and any of them will tell you that I am an honest and 
                  reputable trader with an intense dislike for pirates
                  <img src="smile.gif.html" border="0" width="15" height="15">.<br>
                  <br>
                  New Account: Hey, this sounds great. Here's my contact info, 
                  maybe we can discuss this further. [Fake contact info].<br>
                  <br>
                  By the end of the first day, we had about 20 distinct threads 
                  averaging 15 replies long which, for many eve forums, was the 
                  equivalent length of a strand of DNA unfurled to the sun and 
                  back 1000 times. A pair of lesser men would have stopped there 
                  and sat back on their laurels. But Trazir and I talked about 
                  it, and in order to further add legitimacy to our blueprint 
                  scam, we decided that in addition to our (promised) 150 
                  million credit contributions, we would create a number of fake 
                  investors with the new accounts, and have those new accounts 
                  publicly announce their investor status. Although this would 
                  siphon off a good deal of our potential profit, it would be 
                  crucial social proof that we were the real deal. At that 
                  point, we needed social proof more than OJ ever needed his 
                  attorneys. <br>
                  <br>
                  After hours upon hours of posting, spamming, and flat-out 
                  bullshitting, I felt about ready to collapse on the floor in a 
                  dishevelled heap. But the Great Magnet saw my efforts, and I 
                  suddenly felt its pull. There, in my ICQ contacts list, was 
                  HardHead, back from whatever unfathomable depth he had 
                  journeyed to. I wasted no time.<br>
                  <br>
                  Me: Hey man, it's good to see you back. Where the hell did you 
                  go all that time?
                  <img src="smile.gif.html" border="0" width="15" height="15"><br>
                  <br>
                  HH: I had to cram my final computer science project in 3 days, 
                  so for the past week, all I've been doing basically is 
                  working. I'm glad that I can finally return to Eve.<br>
                  <br>
                  Me: So am I. Hey, I don't really wanna press this issue again, 
                  I know you're thinking about it, but the battleship deal.. 
                  there's been a pretty big response for it dude. I know you're 
                  into manufacturing and all that, and I want to keep this deal 
                  open for you for as long as possible, but I can honestly say 
                  that I doubt there will be any available investment slots by 
                  this time next week. <br>
                  <br>
                  HH: Damn.. has the response really been that big? Do you think 
                  I could meet some of the other investors?<br>
                  <br>
                  Fuck. I hadn't planned on that one. The sweat began to drip 
                  down my armpits past my side, and the room temperature became 
                  extremely hot. I'd have to wing it.<br>
                  <br>
                  Me: Yeah bro, definitely. This is a large amount of money 
                  we're talking about.. a minimum contribution of 60 million, so 
                  I can understand your wanting to meet the other people who 
                  would be involved. As a matter of fact, tomorrow night at 8 PM 
                  est we're gonna have an investor meeting in IRC to further 
                  discuss the deal and answer any additional questions. <br>
                  <br>
                  HH: All right, that sounds good.<br>
                  <br>
                  Me: Okay man, I've been up for way too long, I think I'm gonna 
                  go pass out now. Peace.<br>
                  <br>
                  HH: See ya.<br>
                  <br>
                  I left ICQ and raised my phone receiver with the speed of a 
                  man on the chase. I pounded each key with the same sort of 
                  desperate enthusiasm I recalled feeling during my short-lived 
                  combat career.<br>
                  <br>
                  Trazir: &quot;Hello?&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Me: &quot;Tomorrow night at eight we're gonna have an investor 
                  meeting on IRC.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Trazir: &quot;Uh... an investor meeting? I didn't think we had any 
                  investors.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Me: &quot;Well, we've got one now. A potential one. And if he's 
                  gonna join up, he's gonna need to see other investors. You 
                  know which investors I mean by 'others'. THE FAKE ONES.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Trazir: &quot;Fuck. Okay, what should I do?&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Me: &quot;Go post the time and location of our meeting in each of 
                  our investment threads. We had what, 20 threads all together?&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Trazir: &quot;Yeah, around 20. Okay, this will also give me the 
                  chance to bump them.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Me: &quot;I'm gonna go register the channel we'll need to use, call 
                  it #apocinvest, and write up an outline for what will be said 
                  during the meeting. Both us and the fakes will be opped, and 
                  any others who drop by will be voiced. This will allow us to 
                  at least differentiate between each other somewhat during the 
                  confusion. I'll figure out the rest tomorrow, so go update 
                  those threads and get a good night of sleep. Later.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Trazir: &quot;Adios.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  As I placed the receiver down, a grin slowly creeped onto my 
                  face. I opened up Outlook in the vain hope that somebody had 
                  sent me an email expressing interest in ZZZZ Best. The creep 
                  on my face turned into a sprint of joy as I read the message 
                  requesting more information about the blueprint deal. His name 
                  was Magnulus, and he was the CEO of a mining corporation named 
                  Alltech. My hard work had finally paid off! With all those 
                  fake posts, this douche bag probably thought he was one 
                  amongst a hundred others asking for a chance to be a part of 
                  this great and wondrous business arrangement. I replied with 
                  the IRC information and thanked him for his interest.<br>
                  <br>
                  Tomorrow would be a long day.</font><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" color="white"><br>
