                  <font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" color="white">I spent the 
                  next day preparing a syllabus, writing out which questions 
                  would be asked by the fake investors during our IRC meeting. 
                  While I did this, Trazir hyped the fuck out of the 
                  get-together which would be occurring later that night. This 
                  would be a true test of our skills as scammers, an 
                  intellectual battle to the death, winner takes all, and I 
                  would have to be ready. I then logged into Eve for the first 
                  time in a week and spent the afternoon recruiting newbies into 
                  ZZZZ Best, since half of the originals had already left, and a 
                  9 member corporation doesnt look too secure if youre 
                  considering a multi-million credit investment. <br>
                  <br>
                  By the time 7:30 rolled around, ZZZZ Best was back up to 15 
                  members. Not as high as I would have liked it, but for the 
                  time, it would have to suffice. I logged out of Eve, glad to 
                  be away from the abysmally ugly starter ship, and dialed 
                  Trazir.<br>
                  <br>
                  Trazir: Hello?<br>
                  <br>
                  Me: The meeting starts in 25 minutes. You ready?<br>
                  <br>
                  Trazir: Yeah. You should start logging your clients into the 
                  IRC. Get it? CLIENTS?<br>
                  <br>
                  Me: Man, thats terrible. Go on AIM, Ill send you the text 
                  file for what the fake accounts will say and what our 
                  responses will be. You can give the opening statement which is 
                  all written out, and then well start fielding questions. <br>
                  <br>
                  Trazir: Okay, but lets not talk on the phone during the 
                  meeting. I cant type and speak at the same time, and my ear 
                  is already starting to hurt.<br>
                  <br>
                  Me: All right. Go into IRC, Ill see you there.<br>
                  <br>
                  I hung up the phone and messaged HardHead, telling him that 
                  the meeting would start soon. He assured me that he would be 
                  there.<br>
                  <br>
                  Aside from me, Trazir, and the fake investors, the IRC channel 
                  felt more abandoned than a ghost town, and it was just 5 
                  minutes until the meeting began.<br>
                  <br>
                  &lt;Trazir&gt; What the hell? Didnt you say there would be like 10 
                  prospects in here? <br>
                  <br>
                  &lt;Me&gt; Give them time, it still isnt 8 yet.<br>
                  <br>
                  I entered into all the major Eve Online channels in the server 
                  and respectably spammed the location of our meeting. I was 
                  banned from #Eve-Pirates, but I never liked those fuckers 
                  anyway.<br>
                  <br>
                  And all of a sudden, just like the Persians at Thermopylae, 
                  they came. They came harder than Peter North on a stacked 
                  blonde. We built it, my friends, and they came.<br>
                  <br>
                  HardHead was the first to enter. Following him was a guy named 
                  Thoggins who had the attitude of a perpetually pissed-off 
                  pitbull and the bank account of a Fortune 500 CEO. Several 
                  inconsequential people arrived after him, and then came my new 
                  friend Magnulus, along with several officers of his 
                  corporation. I snickered at the fact that a big corporate man 
                  actually took this deal seriously. The last important person 
                  to enter was a guy called Jorpho, a big-time ship manufacturer 
                  who was notorious for his hatred of pirates. I had a feeling 
                  we would get along. <br>
                  <br>
                  The meeting proceeded wonderfully. Trazir read my introduction 
                  word for word, and we fielded the pre-written investor 
                  questions. By the 15 minute mark, I was fairly certain that 
                  every prospective investor in the room was unequivocally 
                  dazzled. <br>
                  <br>
                  Suddenly, something strange happened. Thoggins decided that it 
                  would be a good idea to message one of the fake investors with 
                  questions of his own; questions for which I had little 
                  appreciation.<br>
                  <br>
                  &lt;Thoggins&gt; Hey, whats the deal with this Nightfreeze guy 
                  anyway? Ive never heard of him before, and all of a sudden 
                  hes fronting 1.125 billion isk. It seems sorta fishy to me.<br>
                  <br>
                  &lt;Fake Investor&gt; Yeah, I know what you mean. I felt that way 
                  too when I first got into this deal, but Ive had many 
                  conversations with him and run several trade routes with him. 
                  Hell, Ive even talked to him on the phone. Hes a trustworthy 
                  guy.<br>
                  <br>
                  &lt;Thoggins&gt; Hmm okay. That doesnt change the fact though that 
                  his name is gayer than Christopher Lowell, lol.<br>
                  <br>
                  I gritted my teeth as I felt my blood pressure starting to 
                  rise.<br>
                  <br>
                  &lt;Fake Investor&gt; Hehe, yeah.<br>
                  <br>
                  &lt;Thoggins&gt; Tell me more about your phone conversation, I might 
                  be interested in that. If this guy fucks me over, I can just 
                  spam his number repeatedly.<br>
                  <br>
                  &lt;Fake Investor&gt; Well, we were talking one night on AIM, and I 
                  told him that, while I trusted him and all, I wasnt sure if I 
                  could go through with the payment. He asked me for my phone 
                  number and called me up, and we had a nice long conversation 
                  about it. Then he gave me his number and told me I could call 
                  him any time I wanted to. That was when I knew it, Nightfreeze, 
                  despite having a dumb name, is one of the most honest people 
                  Ive ever met.<br>
                  <br>
                  &lt;Thoggins&gt; Okay, but whats his number?<br>
                  <br>
                  &lt;Fake Investor&gt; Id like to give it to you, but Im not sure 
                  if he would want me to. Im sure that if you asked him, he 
                  would give it. Sorry ;p. <br>
                  <br>
                  After about 35 minutes, the fake investors questions had run 
                  dry. Now it was the prospective investors turn to speak. To 
                  my delight, none of them had any questions; all their concerns 
                  and fears had been answered, and my closing statement drove 
                  the stake in all the way.<br>
                  <br>
                  &lt;Nightfreeze&gt; As you esteemed investors may know, the total 
                  amount of capital placed in this blueprint pool is now at a 
                  total of 625 million isk. We are more than halfway to our goal 
                  of the best damn ship in the game, and it is because of all of 
                  you. I will be sending out my nightly email to each of you 
                  saying where your standing is in the investment pool, and by 
                  what day you will receive your blueprint copy. As for you 
                  prospective investors, I would implore you to act quickly and 
                  invest before somebody else does; this pool has only been in 
                  existence for a week, and it is already more than halfway 
                  towards its lofty goal. Since none of you appear to have any 
                  further questions, I will stay on for 15 more minutes in case 
                  you have any private concerns you would like to message me 
                  with. I cant stay on for any longer though, because I need to 
                  put my daughter to sleep ;p. You can also contact me any time 
                  at [Contact Info].<br>
                  <br>
                  Note: I do not have a daughter. (That I know of)<br>
                  <br>
                  My family man image had been placed, and something told me 
                  that each and every one of those prospective investors was 
                  ensnared. Moments later, I received a message from Thoggins.<br>
                  <br>
                  &lt;Thoggins&gt; Nice meeting, but Id like to talk to you in person 
                  before I invest my money. Can I call you sometime?<br>
                  <br>
                  &lt;Me&gt; Sure you can. My wife is on the phone with the bank right 
                  now, shes been on for 45 minutes already and I dont think 
                  shell be off any time soon. Ill be on AIM tomorrow around 
                  noon, why dont you contact me then and well talk further.<br>
                  <br>
                  Note: I do not have a wife. (That I know of)<br>
                  <br>
                  &lt;Thoggins&gt; Youd better be on, or Im not investing a dime. 
                  Understood?<br>
                  <br>
                  If Thoggins were an ant colony, I would kick him over, flood 
                  him, burn him, then crucify his eggs right after they hatched.<br>
                  <br>
                  &lt;Me&gt; Yup.<br>
                  <br>
                  At the same time Thoggins messaged me, I also received a 
                  message from HardHead.<br>
                  <br>
                  &lt;HardHead&gt; Ive been thinking about it, and Im gonna go 
                  ahead and do it. Ill invest. Im tired of mining, you know? 
                  It seems like this deal is the only way for me to get a 
                  blueprint Id need to build battleships. And that would be a 
                  very profitable venture too.<br>
                  <br>
                  &lt;Me&gt; Thats great to hear man. I can honestly say that of all 
                  the people who are investing in this, you and Trazir are my 
                  best friends. Ive known you for months now in Eve, and 
                  without you loaning me that starting money, I wouldnt be 
                  where I am right now. Because of that, Ill give you a 
                  discount; you probably know that anybody who invests 120 
                  million or over gets a fully upgraded blueprint copy after all 
                  the investors have received their first copies. Well, Ill 
                  bring that level down. For you, 80 million.<br>
                  <br>
                  &lt;HardHead&gt; Hmm. That sounds good to me. Can I wire the money 
                  now?<br>
                  <br>
                  &lt;Me&gt; Lets do it tomorrow. Im about to go tuck my daughter 
                  into bed. Have a good night.<br>
                  <br>
                  &lt;HardHead&gt; You too.<br>
                  <br>
                  I logged off. My conscience didnt bother me a bit.</font><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" color="white"><br>
